# Introduction
## Understanding AI and computer vision

## Understanding the AI-900 certification and exam
- Entry level, not focused on coding or implementation
- AI focus
	- Cognitive services
	- Bots
	- Azure ML
- Non-AI focus
	- Responsible AI principles from Microsoft

# Understanding AI Vision solutions
## Understanding AI Vision solutions
### Definitions
- Computer vision
	- AI field that allows computers to perceive the world visually
- AI
	- Allows computers to mimic capabilities of the human brain (Such as learning, recognizing patterns without needing to be explicitly coded for that, understanding)
- Machine Learning (ML)
	- Process of teaching/training a computer system to make predictions based on available data
- Deep Learning (DL)
	- Subset of ML based on artificial neural network
- Convolution neural network (CNN)
		- A class of neural networks
- uuuig

### Process
- Camera
	- Image is captured and converted into a picture/ image file
- Pixels
	- An image is made of several pixels (dots of a particular color)
- Patterns
	- Pixels might form patterns that a vision model can be trained to recognize

### Data, computing, and expertise requirements
- Large datasets (Coco, ImageNet)
- Intensive computing (CPUs, GPUs, VPUs)
- Advanced AI/ML expertise (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, caffe)

### The AI framework for Vision
- AI
- ML (A subset of AI)
- DL (a subset of ML)
	- Applications such as computer vision, NLP and speech recognition
- CNN (subset of DL)
	- a Class of neural networks
	- Supervised learning
	- For images
	- Analyze images on multiple layers
		- Edges
		- Textures
		- patterns
		- object parts
		- objects
	- For videos a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is generally used
		- Retain information that was already previously processed (Predicting an action)


## Computer vision workloads
- Image classification (categorize based on classes you define)
- Object detection (adds a boundry box with coordinates of each object found on the picture)
	- Can tell you what and where
- Semantic segmentation
	- Detects on pixel level which part of the image belongs to them
- Image analysis
		- Tags a picture based on items it contains and generates captions about them
		- Can detect, recognize, compare faces, including facial features such as hair, glasses, age and emotions
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
	- Read text in both images and scan documents (Printed and handwriting)

## The Azure Vision services
### Azure cognitive services
- Built AI-infused apps with no ML/AI knowledge
- Highly refined models
- Ample language support
- Privacy assured
- Low cost, including free tier

### Vision services on Azure
- Computer vision
	- Workloads
		- Classification
		- Object detection
		- Image analysis
		- Limited OCR and facial recognition (small set of facial features such as age, gender)
- Face API
		- Detect
			- Facial hair
			- Glasses
			- Emotions
			- Facial detection and recognition
			- Much more
- Form recognizer 
	- Read and comprehend text on a document
- Custom vision
	- Tailor a vision model according to your needs

### Creating Azure vision resources
- Create dedicated service
	- Admin overhead (Several end points and keys to manage)
- Create consolidated cognitive service
	- Harder to analyze individual costs
	- No free tier

# The computer vision API

### Definitions
- Confidence level
	- Index from zero to one indicating how sure algorithm is on supply description
## The computer vision API
- General purpose vision technology from Microsoft
- Performs both image classification and object detection (bounding box with coordinates)
- Accepts URLs and image binaries (JPG, GIF, PNG and BMP)
- Performs scalable, automated image analysis

### What the service can do
- Detect color schemes on a picture including dominant foreground, background or whether in black and white
- General description of what the picture is about
- Additional information on facial detection
	- Age
	- Gender
	- Coordinates of face on the image
- Thumbnail generation
	- Identifies most relevant part  of a picture
- Generates tags, categories, brands and objects
- Tags vs categories
	- 2000 tags available, 86 different categories
- Objects Computer vision able to detect 10000 of them
	- Similar to taging but while tagging uses image clasification, objects and brands are based on object detection (bounding box with locations)

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
	- Detect  letters, numerals, punctuation/ other text elements on an image
	- Language auto detection
	- Two APIs
		- OCR API (older, less text)
		- Read API (newer, text-heavy)
- Detect content that is adult such as Nudity or sexual acts,racy, gory (Content moderator)
- Celebrities
- Landmarks

### Computer vision is a (CATCH ALL)
Colors and descriptions
Age, gender and face locatioin
Thumbnails
Categories, tags, brands and objects
Handwritting and OCR

Adult, racy, gory
Line drawing and clip art
Landmarks and celebrities
