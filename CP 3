# Understanding AI Vision solutions
## Understanding AI Vision solutions
### Definitions
- Computer vision
	- AI field that allows computers to perceive the world visually
- AI
	- Allows computers to mimic capabilities of the human brain (Such as learning, recognizing patterns without needing to be explicitly coded for that, understanding)
- Machine Learning (ML)
	- Process of teaching/training a computer system to make predictions based on available data
- Deep Learning (DL)
	- Subset of ML based on artificial neural network
- Convolution neural network (CNN)
		- A class of neural networks
- uuuig

### Process
- Camera
	- Image is captured and converted into a picture/ image file
- Pixels
	- An image is made of several pixels (dots of a particular color)
- Patterns
	- Pixels might form patterns that a vision model can be trained to recognize

### Data, computing, and expertise requirements
- Large datasets (Coco, ImageNet)
- Intensive computing (CPUs, GPUs, VPUs)
- Advanced AI/ML expertise (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, caffe)

### The AI framework for Vision
- AI
- ML (A subset of AI)
- DL (a subset of ML)
	- Applications such as computer vision, NLP and speech recognition
- CNN (subset of DL)
	- a Class of neural networks
	- Supervised learning
	- For images
	- Analyze images on multiple layers
		- Edges
		- Textures
		- patterns
		- object parts
		- objects
	- For videos a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is generally used
		- Retain information that was already previously processed (Predicting an action)


## Computer vision workloads
- Image classification (categorize based on classes you define)
- Object detection (adds a boundry box with coordinates of each object found on the picture)
	- Can tell you what and where
- Semantic segmentation
	- Detects on pixel level which part of the image belongs to them
- Image analysis
		- Tags a picture based on items it contains and generates captions about them
		- Can detect, recognize, compare faces, including facial features such as hair, glasses, age and emotions
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
	- Read text in both images and scan documents (Printed and handwriting)

## The Azure Vision services
### Azure cognitive services
- Built AI-infused apps with no ML/AI knowledge
- Highly refined models
- Ample language support
- Privacy assured
- Low cost, including free tier

### Vision services on Azure
- Computer vision
	- Workloads
		- Classification
		- Object detection
		- Image analysis
		- Limited OCR and facial recognition (small set of facial features such as age, gender)
- Face API
		- Detect
			- Facial hair
			- Glasses
			- Emotions
			- Facial detection and recognition
			- Much more
- Form recognizer 
	- Read and comprehend text on a document
- Custom vision
	- Tailor a vision model according to your needs

### Creating Azure vision resources
- Create dedicated service
	- Admin overhead (Several end points and keys to manage)
- Create consolidated cognitive service
	- Harder to analyze individual costs
	- No free tier

# The computer vision API

### Definitions
- Confidence level
	- Index from zero to one indicating how sure algorithm is on supply description
## The computer vision API
- General purpose vision technology from Microsoft
- Performs both image classification and object detection (bounding box with coordinates)
- Accepts URLs and image binaries (JPG, GIF, PNG and BMP)
- Performs scalable, automated image analysis

### What the service can do
- Detect color schemes on a picture including dominant foreground, background or whether in black and white
- General description of what the picture is about
- Additional information on facial detection
	- Age
	- Gender
	- Coordinates of face on the image
- Thumbnail generation
	- Identifies most relevant part  of a picture
- Generates tags, categories, brands and objects
- Tags vs categories
	- 2000 tags available, 86 different categories
- Objects Computer vision able to detect 10000 of them
	- Similar to taging but while tagging uses image clasification, objects and brands are based on object detection (bounding box with locations)

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
	- Detect  letters, numerals, punctuation/ other text elements on an image
	- Language auto detection
	- Two APIs
		- OCR API (older, less text)
		- Read API (newer, text-heavy)
- Detect content that is adult such as Nudity or sexual acts,racy, gory (Content moderator)
- Celebrities
- Landmarks

### Computer vision is a (CATCH ALL)
Colors and descriptions
Age, gender and face locatioin
Thumbnails
Categories, tags, brands and objects
Handwritting and OCR

Adult, racy, gory
Line drawing and clip art
Landmarks and celebrities

# The Face API
## The Face API
### Facial recognition: Use cases
- Security and identity validation
- Social media
- Intelligent monitoring
- Advertising
- Missing persons

### Face detection vs face recognition
#### Face detection
- Detect gender attributes (features) such as gender, age, smile, hair (hair color and facial hair), head-pose, glasses makeup
- Bounding box coordinates
- Emotions (The closer to 1 the stronger the emotion attached to it)
	- Neutral, anger, contempt, disgust
	- Fear, happiness, sadness and surprise
- Generates a set of 27 face landmarks in an associatd face ID
- Picture sent is discarded after landmarks are generated and face ID expires 24hafter being generated
- 
#### Facial recognition
- Identify people in pictures or your face for authentication
- Process
	- Create a persons group
	- Register the persons
	- Upload  face pictures (up to 248) (front facing, no profile)
	- Train model
- operations
	- Verifies a face against the persons group
	- Find similar
	- Group (group pictures according to the faces)
	- Identify (checks for possible face matches)

# The Form Recognizer
## The Form recognizer
- OCR
	- Well-established technology
	- Common to most scanners
- Limitations
	- OCR can read the characters, but not understand the data
- Form recognizer
	- Uses ML to bring meaning to the values on the form

### Definitions
- Accepts PDFs nd imges (JPG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF)
- Works asynchronously (two API calls)
- Two versions (2.1 and 3.0 (recommended)
- Officially belongs to Applid AI services category:
	- https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/applie-ai-services/

#### Form Recognizer options
- Prebuilt models (Invoices, receipts, business cards, nd IDs)
- Layout API
- Custom  models, trained for your companies needs
