# AI fundamentals
Notes for Exam tips AI exam certification

### Introduction:
 AI-900 indicates fundamentals
Ai focus is more for cognitive service, bots and Azure ML
Non AI focus is Microsoft responsible AI principles (ASCO framework)

***************************************************

# Artificial intelligence in Azure
Reasoning
	Draw conclusions from imperfect data
Understanding
	Interpret meaning of data such as images, video, audio
Interacting
	Communicate in more natural ways

# AI workloads
ML (prediction)
Anomaly detection (Fraud and failure detection)
Computer vision (Classify or detect objects)
Natural language processing (Interpret language)
Conversational AI (Chatbots)


# 3 Technological advancements
## Big data
Cheaper and faster storage

## High compute
GPU and sale-out clusters

## Algorithms
Advancements in AI and ML algorithms

*******************************************************

## Cognitive services
-Building AI infused apps with no ML /AI knowledge
-Highly refined models
-Ample language support
-Privacy assured
-Low cost including free tier

## Cognitive service pillars
Vision (Custom vision)
Speech (Speech studio)
Language (LUIS)
Decision (Content moderator)
Web search (Big custom search)
Create your own AI model

## Cognitive Services decision workflow
Generic (Use generic service)
Custom (custom service/ create own)

## Cognitive Services lifecycle
### Labs (labs.cognitive.microsoft.com)
### Preview (speaker recognition and anomaly detector)
### GA (Generally available)
### Retired
