# AI fundamentals-Exam tips
*************************************************
Notes for Exam tips AI exam certification

### Introduction:
 AI-900 indicates fundamentals
Ai focus is more for cognitive service, bots and Azure ML
Non AI focus is Microsoft responsible AI principles (ASCO framework)

***************************************************

# Artificial intelligence in Azure
Reasoning
	Draw conclusions from imperfect data
Understanding
	Interpret meaning of data such as images, video, audio
Interacting
	Communicate in more natural ways

# AI workloads
ML (prediction)
Anomaly detection (Fraud and failure detection)
Computer vision (Classify or detect objects)
Natural language processing (Interpret language)
Conversational AI (Chatbots)


# 3 Technological advancements
## Big data
Cheaper and faster storage

## High compute
GPU and sale-out clusters

## Algorithms
Advancements in AI and ML algorithms

*******************************************************

## Cognitive services
-Building AI infused apps with no ML /AI knowledge
-Highly refined models
-Ample language support
-Privacy assured
-Low cost including free tier

## Cognitive service pillars
Vision (Custom vision)
Speech (Speech studio)
Language (LUIS)
Decision (Content moderator)
Web search (Big custom search)
Create your own AI model

## Cognitive Services decision workflow
Generic (Use generic service)
Custom (custom service/ create own)

## Cognitive Services lifecycle
### Labs (labs.cognitive.microsoft.com)
### Preview (speaker recognition and anomaly detector)
### GA (Generally available)
### Retired

****************************************

# Microsoft Responsible AI
## Microsoft responsible AI Principles
Fairness
Reliability and safety
Privacy and security
Inclusiveness
Transparency
Accountability

# Vision
## Computer vision (CATCH ALL)
`Colors and descriptions
`Age, gender and face location
`Thumbnails
`Categories, tags, brands and objects
`Handwriting and OCR

`Adult, racy and gory
`Line drawing and clipart
`Landmarks and celebrities

## Face API
1. Create a person group (Or larger person group)
2. Register each person
3. Upload face pictures
4. Train the model

## Form and ink recognizers

### Form recognizer services
Custom models (key/value pair and table extractions)
US receipt format
Layout API (text and table structures)

### Ink recognizer

Process
Ink stroke input--API---Recognition tree

## Custom Vision

### Two main capabilities of custom vision
#### Classification
#### Object detection

### Custom vision details
Interactive portal (www.customvision.ai)
Two separate end point and keys (for training and prediction)
Several specialized domains
Supports edge computing (compact models)

### Custom vision best practices
-Ideally at least 50 images/tag
-Balanced input of images (bananas and oranges)
-Add negative images (neither banana nor orange)
-Fix wrong past predictions to improve the model
