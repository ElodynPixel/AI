# Get stared with Natural Language processing (NLP)
## Understanding NLP
- Analyzing text is a process where you evaluate different aspects of a document/phrase in order to gain insights into the context of that text
#### Text analytics
- A process where an artificial intelligence algorithm evaluates attributes i text to determine specific insights
- Commonly used techniques used to built software to analyze text
	- Statistical analysis
		- Remove common stock words
	- Frequency analysis
		- How often each word appears
	- Stemming (lemmatizaton) algorithms (normalize words before counting them)
		- linguistic structure rules to analyze sentences
			- Breaking down sentences into indistinct structures such as a nun phrase (which itself contains nouns, verbs, adjectives and so on)
	- Two-word phrase= bigram
	- three-word phrase= trigram
- Words encoding
	- Encoding text data as numeric features that can be used to train a machine learning model
	- A technique often used to perform sentiment analysis in which a document can be classified according to positive or negative
- Vectorized models
	- Capture semantic relationships between words by assigning them to locations in an n-dimensional space
	- This modeling technique might assign values to the words photo and image to locate them close to one another

# Conversational AI
Knowledge base - of question and answer pairs - usually with some built-in natural language processing model to enable questions that can be phrased in multiple ways to be understood with the same semantic meaning.
A _bot service_ that provides an interface to the knowledge base through one or more channels.

- Language and Azure bot service
- Language service. 
The Language service includes a custom question answering feature that enables you to create a knowledge base of question and answer pairs that can be queried using natural language input.
- Azure Bot service. 
This service provides a framework for developing, publishing, and managing bots on Azure.

## Creating a custom question answering knowledge base

The first challenge in creating a user support bot is to use the Language service to create a knowledge base. You can use the _Language Studio_'s custom question answering feature to create, train, publish, and manage knowledge bases.

### Provision a Language service Azure resource

To create a knowledge base, you must first provision a **Language service** resource in your Azure subscription.

### Define questions and answers

After provisioning a Language service resource, you can use the Language Studio's custom question answering feature to create a knowledge base that consists of question-and-answer pairs. These questions and answers can be:

- Generated from an existing FAQ document or web page.
- Entered and edited manually.

In many cases, a knowledge base is created using a combination of all of these techniques; starting with a base dataset of questions and answers from an existing FAQ document and extending the knowledge base with additional manual entries.

Questions in the knowledge base can be assigned _alternative phrasing_ to help consolidate questions with the same meaning. For example, you might include a question like:

> _What is your head office location?_

You can anticipate different ways this question could be asked by adding an alternative phrasing such as:

> _Where is your head office located?_


### Test the knowledge base

After creating a set of question-and-answer pairs, you must save it. This process analyzes your literal questions and answers and applies a built-in natural language processing model to match appropriate answers to questions, even when they are not phrased exactly as specified in your question definitions. Then you can use the built-in test interface in the Language Studio to test your knowledge base by submitting questions and reviewing the answers that are returned.

### Use the knowledge base

When you're satisfied with your knowledge base, deploy it. Then you can use it over its REST interface. To access the knowledge base, client applications require:

- The knowledge base ID
- The knowledge base endpoint
- The knowledge base authorization key
