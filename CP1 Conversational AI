# CP 1- Conversational AI
# Identify common conversational AI workloads
### Conversational AI
	Chatbots - communicating using natural language
	Text - Websites or native applications
	Voice - voice assitant


## Overview of common conversational AI workloads
- Augmenting existing capabilities
- Content discovery
- Self-service agents
- Connecting with audience using different channels
- Communicating using natural language
- Providing rapid responses

### Benefits
- Reduced costs
- Increased engagement

## Features and characteristics of chatbots
### Definitions
- Chatbot
	- Interactive software application
- Dialogs
	- The building blocks of conversational logic within a chatbot
### Typical interactions in three high level steps
- Send (Human sends a message to the chatbot)
	- Known as an utterance
- Receive (Chatbot receives messages and uses NLP to infer intent and entities within the message)
- Respond (Chatbot sends an appropriate response)

### Natural language processing (NLP)
- Translating human language into something the machine can understand
- Often a highly complex process
- ML models and text analytics
- User input is categorized into the following:
	- Utterances - A phrase the user sends to the chatbot
	Examples include
		- I would like to place an order plz
		- Can I place an order
		- I would like to order
	- Intents - The end goal the user wants to achieve when interacting with the chatbot
	Examples include
		- Place order
			- I would like to place an order plz
			- Can I place an order?
			- I would like to order
	- Entities - An item of interest within an utterance
	Examples include
		- I would like to order a new {product=phone}
		- I would like a new {product=car} pls
		- Can I have a new {product=keybord} pls
Service responsible for these tasks in Azure is LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligence System)
