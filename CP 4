# Get stared with Natural Language processing (NLP)
## Understanding NLP
- Analyzing text is a process where you evaluate different aspects of a document/phrase in order to gain insights into the context of that text
#### Text analytics
- A process where an artificial intelligence algorithm evaluates attributes i text to determine specific insights
- Commonly used techniques used to built software to analyze text
	- Statistical analysis
		- Remove common stock words
	- Frequency analysis
		- How often each word appears
	- Stemming (lemmatizaton) algorithms (normalize words before counting them)
		- linguistic structure rules to analyze sentences
			- Breaking down sentences into indistinct structures such as a nun phrase (which itself contains nouns, verbs, adjectives and so on)
	- Two-word phrase= bigram
	- three-word phrase= trigram
- Words encoding
	- Encoding text data as numeric features that can be used to train a machine learning model
	- A technique often used to perform sentiment analysis in which a document can be classified according to positive or negative
- Vectorized models
	- Capture semantic relationships between words by assigning them to locations in an n-dimensional space
	- This modeling technique might assign values to the words photo and image to locate them close to one another
